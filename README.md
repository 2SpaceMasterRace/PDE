# PDE
IN PROGRESS [ Will properly need to create a base template and automate everything to perfection ]

###### PDE aka personal development environment is a developer workflow crash course that teaches everything I need to be super productive when building awesome software. Think of this as a "Missing Semester of your CS education" but on Tren.

This also serves as a backup of all my config files which are fully automated, backed-up and reproducable in any machine. It's about being blazingly fast. Also gotta include distro specific optimizations. This will be turned into a CLI app that can navigate between different distros such as Nix or Void Linux; something similar to Omakub.

Currently it has the bare-essentials, will document and optimize soon in the future.
