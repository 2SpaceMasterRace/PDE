# PDE
IN PROGRESS, SHIFTING TO NIX [ Will properly need to create a base template and automate everything to perfection ]

###### PDE aka personal development environment is a developer workflow crash course that teaches everything I need to be super productive when building awesome suckless software. Think of this as a "Missing Semester of your CS education" but on Tren.

This also serves as a backup of all my config files which are fully automated, backed-up and reproducable in any machine. It's about being blazingly fast. Also gotta include distro specific optimizations
